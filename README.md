# Hypothes.isThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Hypothes.is APIs](https://hypothes.is/). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Hypothes.is APIs](https://hypothes.is/).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](https://hypothes.is/)- [Developer](https://hypothes.is/)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hypothes_is)- [GitHub](https://github.com/hypothesis)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/hypothes-is/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Hypothes.is APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
